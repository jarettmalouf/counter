Make a Counter App User Interface with just HTML and CSS
Any static website will do. You could make a portfolio site, or just the user interfaces for a few pages for a project you’re passionate about that you might want to re-make in each of these example projects. Make sure there’s multiple unique pages in this project. I’d recommend a counter app with buttons to increment, decrement, or reset the value. These buttons should not work

Don’t use React or any other libraries. You need to get experience doing things the traditional way so you know why the libraries we use are important. 

Don’t expect any dynamic website on this project. This is purely to make things look pretty. You  probably don’t need javascript.
